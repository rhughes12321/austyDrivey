        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <p> "Austin made me feel at ease the moment I sat behind the wheel of the car.  I hadn't a clue about anything beforehand and he took time to explain everything in terms I could understand. I was encouraged to take frequent lessons and this helped me remember things easily.  In no time I was driving all over Belfast, practising manoeuvres and test routes.  I passed first time after only 25 lessons. Austin was always punctual and reliable, he never let me down.  He was also very flexible when I needed to change my appointments. I have recommended him to all my friends". - Niamh.</p>
